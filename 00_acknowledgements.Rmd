# Acknowledgements {#acknowledgments .unnumbered}

Special thanks are due to my wife, who supported me in so many ways to get this book completed. Also, I would like to thank my son, who patiently watched me sitting at the computer typing this book and encouraged me with hugs, smiles and kisses. Finally, Ida, my mother-in-law, deserves special thanks because she ensured I would not starve while passionately completing this mammoth project.
